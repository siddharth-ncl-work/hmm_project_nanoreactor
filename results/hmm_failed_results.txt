# analysis_1: nano_reactor_v1.1.3_sugar

  1) In collision steps, 41% of the times there was increase in the number of bonds.
  2) Whenever there was increase in the number of bonds, HMM works(decreases) bonds for about 52% of the times
  3) The percentage decrease in the number of bonds is 37% (power)
  4) Average increase in the bonds is 5 and Maximum increase is 12(1 case)
  
  Total bonds = ~55
  Difference = 37%

  1) In collision steps, 27% of the times there was increase in the number of bonds.
  2) Whenever there was increase in the number of bonds, HMM works(decreases) bonds for about 45% of the times.
  3) The percentage decrease in the number of bonds is 52% (power)
  4) Average increase in the bonds is 3 and Maximum increase is 6(1 case)

  Total bonds = ~58
  Difference = 52%

# PS: Reference frame for cycle/collision frame analysis is the non-collison step just before first collision step of that cycle

# number of times = number of frames
